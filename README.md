[CodeGRITS](https://codegrits.github.io/CodeGRITS/) stands for **G**aze **R**ecording & **I**DE **T**racking **S**ystem,
which is a plugin specifically designed
for software engineering (SE) researchers, which is developed by the [SaNDwich Lab](https://toby.li/) at the
[University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/). CodeGRITS is built on top
of [IntelliJ Platform SDK](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/welcome.html), with wide compatibility with the
entire family of [JetBrains IDEs](https://www.jetbrains.com/) and [Tobii eye-tracking devices](https://www.tobii.com/),
to track developers‚Äô IDE interactions and eye gaze data.

The data collected by CodeGRITS can be used by empirical SE researchers to understand the behaviors of developers,
especially those related to eye gaze. CodeGRITS also provides a [real-time data API](developer.md)
for future plugin developers and researchers to design context-aware programming support tools.

## Key Features

- üîç **IDE Tracking**: CodeGRITS tracks developers‚Äô IDE interactions, including mouse clicks, keyboard inputs, etc.
- üëÅÔ∏è **Eye Tracking**: CodeGRITS tracks developers‚Äô eye gaze data
  from [Tobii eye-tracking devices](https://www.tobii.com/), and mapping them to corresponding source code elements.
- üíª **Screen Recording**: CodeGRITS simultaneously records developers‚Äô screen for visualizing their behaviors.
- üî® **Research Toolkit**: CodeGRITS provides a set of extra features for empirical SE
  researchers, including dynamic configuration, activity labeling, real-time data API, etc.
- üóÉÔ∏è **Data Export**: CodeGRITS exports data in XML format for further data analysis. See [Data Format](data.md)
  for more details.

### Cross-platform and Multilingual Support

- [x] CodeGRITS provides cross-platform support for Windows, macOS,
  and Linux, and is expected to be compatible with the entire family of JetBrains IDEs, including IntelliJ IDEA,
  PyCharm, WebStorm, etc.
- [x] CodeGRITS could extract the abstract syntax tree (AST) structure of eye gazes on multiple
  programming languages, as long as the IDE supports them, including Java, Python, C/C++, JavaScript, etc.
