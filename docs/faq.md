# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

#### Q1. What is the difference between CodeGRITS and iTrace?

[iTrace](https://www.i-trace.org/) is a similar tool to CodeGRITS for collecting developers' eye gaze data in several
IDEs, including Eclipse, Visual Studio, and Atom. However, CodeGRITS is built for JetBrains IDEs, which have increased
popularity in the industry and academia.

CodeGRITS also provides a set of extra functionalities, notably IDE tracking and screen recording, for empirical SE
researchers. See [Trackers](usage.md#trackers) for more details.

#### Q2. Can I use CodeGRITS without an eye-tracking device?

Yes. CodeGRITS provides mouse simulation as a substitute for eye gaze. You could also uncheck the `Eye Tracking` option
in the configuration window to disable eye tracker to only use IDE tracker and screen recorder.

#### Q3. How to integrate other eye-tracking devices with CodeGRITS?

See [Accommodating New Eye Trackers](developer.md#accommodating-new-eye-trackers).

#### Q4. How to use CodeGRITS in other JetBrains IDEs?

See [Accommodating New IDEs](developer.md#accommodating-new-ides).
